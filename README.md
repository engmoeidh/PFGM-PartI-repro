Key scripts (in codes/)

PartI_numeric_demo.py — §6 1-D kink demo:
generates kink_profile.png, E_lambda_curve.png, cs2_band.png, and convergence_table.csv (if missing).

PartI_grid_solver.py — Appendix-F radial solver + diagnostics:
generates D1–D3 and writes grid_refinement.csv and virial_diagnostics.csv.

run_tests.py — one-shot orchestration: runs both scripts, ensures CSVs, and sanity-checks the 2nd-order convergence table.
